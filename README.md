# Auto-Calibration

## YAM / ABC-130k on Puget

This fork adds top-camera and wrist-camera calibration using I2RT YAM URDF meshes,
with CUDA motion fitting, optional RAFT flow, optimization videos, overlay videos,
per-scene timing, and a resumable multi-GPU runner. This extension is mesh-based;
a trained YAM Gaussian-splat backend is not included.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zubair-irshad/Autocalib.git
cd Autocalib
bash scripts/setup_yam_puget.sh
bash scripts/run_yam_puget.sh /absolute/path/ABC-130k --wrist
```

The YAM extension does not require cloning the original pipeline's submodules.
Setup downloads the pinned robot mesh assets. Supply your own ABC-130k episodes;
the dataset and generated videos are not committed here.

See [YAM_PUGET.md](YAM_PUGET.md) for Ubuntu/A6000 setup, the tested DIS flow option,
multi-GPU commands, output conventions, and validation limits. Two episodes were
tested locally on CPU; CUDA/RAFT and multi-GPU execution await Puget validation.

### ----

To run calibration on Droid, Robomind and Bridge datasets.


## Setup 🛠️

Run the following to create an environment

```
conda create -n dr_test python=3.10
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision==0.20.1 torchaudio==2.5.1 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
pip install numpy==1.26.4
gsplat==1.4.0

pip install tensorboard ray tqdm mujoco open3d plyfile pytorch-kinematics random-fourier-features-pytorch pytz gradio

pip install moviepy==1.0.3
pip install opencv-python
pip install timm
pip install transformations
```

The most tricky dependency of our codebase is [gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat), which is used for rasterizing Gaussians. We recommend visiting their installation instructions if the plain `pip install` doesn't work. 
 
# Running Calibration on Datasets 😎



Use the following scripts for calibration on batch of data, or use the python files inside them to run on a single video. Note that this code requires specific data structure, which can be checked in the data paths provided in the script.
```bash
# for robomind
bash run_robomind_seiredata.sh

# for droid
bash run_droid_seiredata.sh

# for bridge
bash run_bridge_seiredata.sh

# During optimization, check the inspection_features_1 or inspection_features folder to see the process of each iteration and each frame. You can see the rendered robot getting to the correct position if things go right. Check the supervisualization images also in those folders, to see if the flow estimation is good. Usually, when the flow is good, the calibration will be good.
```

Important: Modify the robot model checkpoint path inside the scripts to the following path:

```bash
# for robomind and droid (franka fr3)
--model_path /data/group_data/katefgroup/datasets/chenyu/drrobot/output/franka_fr3_2f85_highres_finetune_0

# for bridge (widow)
--model_path /data/group_data/katefgroup/datasets/chenyu/drrobot/output/widow0
```

After calibration, you can run the following scripts to visualize the results. Please change the data path in the command.
```bash
# for robomind
python render_batch_robomind_single_seriedata.py --model_path /data/group_data/katefgroup/datasets/chenyu/drrobot/output/franka_fr3_2f85_highres_finetune_0 --scene_path /data/group_data/katefgroup/datasets/robomind/robomind_chenyu/robomind_extract_1/scene_0

# for droid
python render_droid_seriedata.py --model_path /data/group_data/katefgroup/datasets/chenyu/drrobot/output/franka_fr3_2f85_complement_1 --scene_path /data/group_data/katefgroup/datasets/droid_chenyu/droid_extract_3/scene_27

# for bridge
python render_batch_bridge_single.py --model_path /data/group_data/katefgroup/datasets/chenyu/drrobot/output/widow0 --scene_path /data/group_data/katefgroup/datasets/bridge_chenyu/yidi/chenyu/bridge_seriedata/scene16

# The results will be in the data folder, which is specified by --scene_path
```
